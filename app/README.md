## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a **layered MVC-inspired structure**:

```
app/
│
├── api/            # Routes (FastAPI endpoints)
├── services/       # Business logic (ChartGenerator)
├── pipeline/       # Core processing pipeline
│   ├── llm_client.py
│   ├── normalizer.py
│   ├── transformer.py
│   ├── chart_builder.py
│   ├── table_builder.py
│   └── scorecard.py
│
├── schemas/        # Pydantic models
├── utils/          # Caching & helpers
└── main.py         # Entry point
```

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Async LLM Calls

LLM requests are handled asynchronously to avoid blocking the API.

### 2. Thread-Based Parallelism

Heavy operations (charts, tables, scorecards) are executed using a shared thread pool:

```python
run_in_executor(EXECUTOR, ...)
```

### 3. Shared Executor

A global ThreadPoolExecutor avoids thread creation overhead.

### 4. Parallel Chart Building

Multiple charts are generated concurrently using threads.

### 5. Caching

Repeated queries on the same dataset are served instantly.

---

## 🚨 Key Challenges Solved

### ❌ Initial Issue

* Requests were processed sequentially
* Slow response due to blocking operations

### ✅ Fixes Implemented

* Converted pipeline to async
* Offloaded CPU-heavy tasks to threads
* Removed per-request thread pools
* Introduced shared executor

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* LLM latency is the main bottleneck (external API)
* Pandas operations are CPU-bound (limited by Python GIL)
* Free-tier models may throttle concurrent requests

---

## 📦 How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Start server

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### 3. Open API docs

```
http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs
```
